## Typical Journey with OpenRewrite

---
- Me: "Can I show you OpenRewrite?"
- Them: "Wait, this thing just rewrote my code? Like... correctly?!"

---

- Me: "How is it going?  You need any help?"
- Them: "I don't need help. I can do this. I‚Äôll just write my own YAML. How hard can it be?"

---

- Me: "How is it going?  You need any help?"
- Them: "No, no, I‚Äôm good. Totally rolling this out to prod tomorrow."

Six weeks of silence. They‚Äôve gone full rogue. Possibly living off Post-it notes.

---

- Them: "Hey, do you have a recipe that migrates from ancient Spring Boot to the latest with no breaking changes?"
- Them: "Can it deploy to Kubernetes too?"
- Them: "Do you have any recipes for Cobol?"

---

- Them: "Okay, I might've promised the team support for Spring Data Kafka, Redis, Elasticsearch, Angular, Kubernetes, and Terraform... yesterday."

The eyes say "help," but the Slack message says "quick question."

---

- Them: "Why isn‚Äôt everyone in my org using this already?!"

PowerPoint decks appear. Acronyms are weaponized. A ‚ÄúCenter of Excellence‚Äù is born.

---

- Them: "If I convince Security and Architecture to approve this, I'll finally make a name for myself in this company!"

They‚Äôve renamed their internal Slack channel #rewrite-revolution.

---

- Them: "I tried to automate all our app upgrades‚Ä¶ and now nothing builds."

Jenkins is crying. The cat is judging. The pom.xml is unrecognizable with custom plugins named 'revolutionizr'.

---

- Them: "Can someone just tell me when there are new recipes? Or if mine are deprecated? Or if my choices in life were wrong?"

Subscribes to the newsletter. Joins Discord. Watches for updates like a hawk watches the skies.

---

- Them: "Okay‚Ä¶ maybe I can‚Äôt do this alone and run the platform, deliver regular releases, and meet quarterly goals."

Realizes OpenRewrite is a team sport‚Äîand asks for a coach.

---

- Them: "Wait. If I get this working‚Ä¶ I could save hundreds of hours. Maybe thousands‚Ä¶ We could be happy again."

The dream returns. So do the spreadsheets.

---

- Them: "So about this Continuous Remediation thing‚Ä¶ can we set up a recurring call?"

Full circle. Enlightenment achieved. They bring friends this time.

### Typical Journey with OpenRewrite
#### 12-stages of grief

---

### Good, Better, Best

Notes:
- I want to show you what I‚Äôve been seeing
- out there
- across the customers I‚Äôve worked with
- across industries
- across the globe.
- Most organizations fall into one of three buckets.
- Let‚Äôs walk through what I‚Äôm calling: Good, Better, and Best.
- Around Continuous Migration and OpenRewrite Adoption

---

### Good

- ‚úÖ At least one N-0 application
- ‚ùå Not automated across all workloads
- ‚ùå Not migrating at scale
- üîí Preventing CVEs from going to production

Notes:
- In the 'Good' bucket, there‚Äôs usually at least one Big-A Application
- that‚Äôs made it to N-0, on Spring Boot 3.x and Java 21.
- That team found value, measured it
- They are leveraging OpenRewrite recipes, but manually
- But the effort hasn‚Äôt scaled organically
- Limited to a handful of teams
- Preventing CVEs from going to production, sounds good
- However, its also preventing the ***Reduction*** of CVEs from going to production
- Going from Spring Boot 2.3, to Spring Boot 2.4, closes CVEs, but not all of them

---

### Better

- ‚úÖ Migration Automation
- ‚ùå Not automated across all workloads
- ‚úÖ Knowledge & Visibility of Dependencies
- ‚úÖ At least one "dead" dependency
- ‚úÖ At least one "feature complete" N-0 application
- ‚úÖ Measuring migration outcomes in $$$

Notes:
- Have migration automation in places (not everywhere)
- Know which libraries are in use but no longer supported
- The also know where those libraries are used
- Have migrated at least one "dead"/"unsupported"/"no longer maintained" dependency to something new
- Have multiple N-0 applications
- Have at least one application, that is no longer under active development, that is N-0

---

### Best

- ‚úÖ Migration Automation Momentum
- ‚úÖ Matured from reactive to proactive
- ‚úÖ Migration Engineers
- ‚úÖ Focused efforts at scale
- ‚ùå Struts

Notes:
- Teams/repositories are being added *monthly*
- The migration automation has its own *gravity* pulling in more workloads
- No need for internal marketing
- Have 2 or 3 migration engineers that know how to create and maintain OpenRewrite recipes for their internal projects
- Can identify which applications to focus on for the most value
- Can address critical issues quickly and at scale
- Still haven't migrated everything off of Struts
- but they know where Struts is being used
- They have a plan to address it

---

### Migration Engineers

- ‚ùå Not a title that they wear
- ‚úÖ A responsibility that they share
- ‚úÖ Increased Job Satisfaction

Notes:
- Let‚Äôs talk about these engineers for a second.
- They‚Äôre not wearing a special title. It‚Äôs not even their full-time job.
- But they‚Äôre curious, they learn the tooling, and they help others succeed.
- They deliver outcomes that affect the whole org.
- And you know what? They love this work.
- Because when you help reduce risk and improve performance at scale, that‚Äôs deeply satisfying.
