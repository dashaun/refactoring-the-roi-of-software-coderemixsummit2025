### Demo

Notes:
Let's kick things off with a demo.
The goal here isn’t just to impress you with numbers
though some of them are impressive
but to ground this entire conversation in something real.
I was doing this demo at least 20-times per week for most of 2024

### Reality

Notes:
- Okay, so those numbers in the demo?
- They’re not typical.
- I’m not pretending every org will see results like that right away, or ever.
- But here’s the deal: even small, single-digit percentage improvements
- done regularly
- continuously
- add up to massive wins.
- This is where the investment pays off.
