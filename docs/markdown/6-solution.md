# 🧩 The Solution
### Why OpenRewrite Wins

Notes:
Other frameworks have come and gone.
OpenRewrite is the winner.
It's not just a tool.
Its *The* tool that organizations are building on top of
for Continuous Migrations

---

## 🏆 Built to Win

- Enterprise-grade refactoring at scale
- Supports Java—and **more** 🧑‍💻
- CI/CD integration ready out of the box ⚙️
- You can start today. And grow tomorrow.

Notes:
OpenRewrite was born in the Java ecosystem, but it’s grown beyond that.
It now supports several other languages
This means you can use a single, unified approach across your enterprise.

## ⚙️ Manual is a Start
### But Automation is the Unlock 🔓

- Policy-as-code for code quality 🧾
- Refactor in CI 🧪
- At scale, across **hundreds or thousands** of services 🌍

Notes:
Yes, manual runs are helpful.
They're how every customer starts.
But once you see it works, don’t stop there.
The next level is automating those refactors at scale.
That’s where things really change.

## 🧠 You Already Know It Works

- Proven in your stack ✅
- Trusted by teams like yours 🤝
- Now it’s time to **scale** your impact 📈

> "If it worked in one repo... imagine what it could do across *all* of them."

Notes:
I've been talking about OpenRewrite heavily for over 3 years.
If this is the first time you are hearing about OpenRewrite, thank YOU for sticking around,
If this is the first time you are hearing about OpenRewrite, congratulations, new tool unlocked!
If you are still unsure, ask around, this is real.
My challenge to you is this: if it worked for one app, there’s no reason it can’t work for *all* your apps
"eventually" (I'm looking at you Struts)

## 💥 Outcomes, Not Just Optimism

By the end of 2025, you could:

- Ship the new app that generates 💸 millions
- *Or* improve 🔁 hundreds of existing apps
- And unlock **millions** in savings 💰

Notes:
Here’s the takeaway: you don’t have to choose between innovation and maintenance.
You can deliver *new value* and *capture hidden value* at the same time.\
That’s the OpenRewrite advantage.
