### Refactoring the ROI of Software
##### Lessons from the Frontlines of OpenRewrite Adoption

<!--

### Abstract:

Software running in production today is often unpatched, yet businesses and customers place their trust in it daily. In this session, I’ll share stories from the frontlines of working with organizations worldwide to adopt OpenRewrite. We'll explore the state of software before OpenRewrite, the challenges teams faced, and some lessons learned about building maintainable systems.

Discover how OpenRewrite is transforming the ROI of software by enabling teams to refactor with confidence, keep their systems secure, and future-proof their applications. We'll also explore the current landscape of teams that have mastered OpenRewrite, showcasing how they’ve turned maintenance into a competitive advantage.

The future of software development is clear: if we design with maintenance in mind, we create organizations that are more efficient, secure, and, ultimately, more enjoyable places to work. Join me as we explore this evolving story and envision a better path forward.

### Background:

Most weeks, since summer 2022, I've been engaged with 5-15 different customers, for 1-2 hours each, every week. Small touches with teams, ranging from a few weeks with some teams, to over a year with others. I want to share some of the encouraging outcomes I've seen. I want to try to capture the joy that I see, when customers realize how powerful OpenRewrite is. I want to leave the audience knowing, that the software they build today, can deliver more value than ever with continuous migration and remediation. I will use Spring Boot migrations, the demos that I give ~20 times every week, combined with the best stories and accomplishments that I can bring. I realize it will be hard to do all of that in 25-minutes, but I have a ton of use-cases to pull from, I'll focus on the highlights.
